# Calculator in TypeScript

I have added the functionality to copy the result in the original code, which you can find here: [Calculator GitHub Repository](https://github.com/saman2007/Calculator). This feature allows you to easily copy the calculated result to your clipboard with a simple click, enhancing the usability of the calculator.
